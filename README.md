## 🔍 What is this?

**Deepfake Detection App** is a web-based tool that allows users to upload video frames (as images) and instantly detect whether they are **REAL or FAKE** using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It’s deployed using Gradio, making it accessible and interactive for everyone.

✅ No huge dataset downloads  
✅ No complex setup  
✅ Runs directly in Colab or on your local machine  
✅ Can be deployed to Hugging Face Spaces for free!
